# Google-Analytics-Tiktok-Porfolio-Projects
This repository contains Python Notebook files for the five portfolio projects required for the Google Advanced Data Anayltics program featured by Coursera. Also included are excutive summaries of each project. The `tiktok_dataset.csv` is a synthetic dataset provided by Tiktok in partnership with Google.

## Part 2
TikTok’s data team is in the earliest stages of the claims classification project. The following tasks are needed before the team can begin the data analysis process:

- Build a dataframe for the TikTok dataset
- Examine data type of each column
- Gather descriptive statistics

`Pandas` and `Numpy` were used to complete this project.

## Part 3
TikTok’s data team is working on the claims classification project. The following tasks are needed before the team can begin the data analysis process:

- EDA and cleaning
- Select and build visualization(s) type
  - Create plots to visualize variables and relationships between variables
- Share your results with the TikTok team

`Pandas`, `Numpy`, `Matplotlib.pyplot`, and `Seaborn` were used to complete this project.

## Part 4
TikTok’s data team is working on the claims classification project. The following tasks are needed at this stage of the project:

- Explore the project data
- Implement a hypothesis test
- Communicate insights with stakeholders within TikTok

`Pandas`, `Numpy`, `Matplotlib.pyplot`, `Seaborn`, and `SciPy.stats` were used to complete this project.

## Part 5
TikTok’s data team is working on the claims classification project. The following tasks are needed at this stage of the project:

- Determine the correct modeling approach
- Build a regression model
- Finish checking model assumptions
- Evaluate the model
- Interpret model results and summarize findings for cross-departmental stakeholders within TikTok

`Pandas`, `Numpy`, `Matplotlib.pyplot`, `Seaborn`, and `Scikit-learn` were used to complete this project.

## Part 6
TikTok’s data team is near the end of the claims classification project. The following tasks are needed to complete the project:

- Model building
- Model evaluation
- Summarize findings for cross-departmental stakeholders within TikTok

`Pandas`, `Numpy`, `Matplotlib.pyplot`, `Seaborn`, `Scikit-learn`, and `XGBoost` were used to complete this project.
